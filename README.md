# Applied-Dynamic-Systems-Project
Final project designed for the Applied Dynamic Systems class (MXET 375) in the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution department at Texas A&amp;M University

## Summary
The project simulation file, [FinalProject.slx](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Applied-Dynamic-Systems-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/FinalProject.slx), is a Simulink model file. Simulink (.slx) files are used in MATLAB's Simulink environment to build, simulate, and analyze dynamic systems using block diagrams. These models are often used for engineering projects involving control systems, signal processing, mechanical, electrical, or other dynamic system simulations.

This is for an "Applied Dynamic Systems" class project — this file contains a graphical model (block diagram) of an electro-mechanical system (solenoid actuated spring-mass-damper) dynamic system, which was designed, simulated, and analyzed as part of coursework.

Typical uses of a .slx Simulink file include:

- Modeling physical systems (like motors, circuits, or mechanical linkages)
- Simulating the system's behavior over time
- Designing and testing controllers (PID, state-space, etc.)
- Visualizing signals and system responses

To know the exact contents—such as what system is modeled, what inputs/outputs are used, and what the simulation demonstrates—you would need to open the file in MATLAB Simulink.
